# BAJA-SAE-Drivetrain-Engineering
As the **Drivetrain Engineer** on our collegiate Baja SAE Competition Team, I focused on the design, tuning, and integration of the vehicle’s core powertrain components. This repository highlights my individual contributions to the drivetrain system, including SolidWorks models, performance diagnostics, and design research.

## My Contributions

- **Engine & Fuel System Integration**  
  - Designed and positioned the **engine**, **fuel tank**, and **fuel line routing** in the full vehicle assembly.
  - Developed a **custom splash guard** to protect the powertrain during off-road events.
  - Ensured safe and efficient packaging within the chassis using SolidWorks.

- **CVT & Drivetrain Optimization**  
  - Tuned the **Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT)** to improve torque delivery and reduce belt slippage.
  - Diagnosed and resolved drivetrain issues including throttle response, gearbox misalignment, and fuel delivery inconsistencies.

- **Design Research** (with teammate Zach Sun)  
  - Conducted research on drivetrain material selection and splash guard performance.
  - Created comparison matrices and design justifications included in our formal documentation.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- `SolidWorks` – Full assembly modeling and subsystem integration  
- `CVT Tuning Tools` – On-track adjustment and performance logging  
- `Hand Tools` – Precision fitting, bracket fabrication, and mount adjustments  
- `MS Word / Excel` – Design documentation and performance tracking

## 🏁 Competition Impact

The drivetrain upgrades directly contributed to:
- More consistent **power delivery** in acceleration events  
- Fewer mechanical issues during **endurance runs**  
- Improved **system modularity** for future teams
