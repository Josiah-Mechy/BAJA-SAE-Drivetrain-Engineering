# BAJA-SAE-Drivetrain-Engineering
As the **Drivetrain Engineer** on our collegiate Baja SAE Competition Team, I focused on the design, tuning, and integration of the vehicle’s core powertrain components. This repository highlights my individual contributions to the drivetrain system, including SolidWorks models, performance diagnostics, and design research.

## My Contributions

- **Engine & Fuel System Integration**  
  - Designed and positioned the **engine**, **fuel tank**, and **fuel line routing** in the full vehicle assembly.
  - Developed a **custom splash guard** to protect the powertrain during off-road events.
  - Ensured safe and efficient packaging within the chassis using SolidWorks.

- **CVT & Drivetrain Optimization**  
  - Tuned the **Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT)** to improve torque delivery and reduce belt slippage.
  - Diagnosed and resolved drivetrain issues including throttle response, gearbox misalignment, and fuel delivery inconsistencies.

- **Design Research** (with teammate Zach Sun)  
  - Conducted research on drivetrain material selection and splash guard performance.
  - Created comparison matrices and design justifications included in our formal documentation.

## What I Learned

As the Drivetrain Engineer during the Spring 2026 design phase of our Baja SAE vehicle, I strengthened my technical foundation and engineering mindset while gaining hands-on experience in:

- **Advanced SolidWorks Modeling**  
  Gained confidence in designing detailed, manufacturable drivetrain components — including the engine, splash guard, and fuel tank — and integrating them into the full vehicle assembly with accuracy and intent.

- **Subsystem Integration & Packaging**  
  Learned how to design for spatial constraints and cross-system compatibility, ensuring that drivetrain components aligned with the chassis, fuel system, and CVT layout in a cohesive and functional way.

- **Design for Off-Road Environments**  
  Considered durability, debris protection, and ease of maintenance during CAD development — especially for components like the splash guard and fuel routing.

- **Team Collaboration in an Engineering Workflow**  
  Coordinated with other subsystem leads and collaborated closely with my research partner, Zach Sun, to ensure our designs aligned with the team's overall goals and constraints.

- **Technical Communication & Documentation**  
  Created clear design presentations and contributed to formal team documentation for review, demonstrating our decision-making process, design tradeoffs, and engineering rationale.
